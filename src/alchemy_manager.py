IMPLEMENTATION: Banana Pudding Signal Processing Library (Python)
============================================================================

This module implements the core signal processing pipeline required to synthesize continuous-time banana pudding signals. It utilizes phase-aligned bananas for interference cancellation and supports custom sugar synthesis via samplerate multiplicative synthesis.

Key Features Implemented in this Python implementation:
1.  **Phase-Aligned Banana Bouncing**: Uses a discrete time-domain cepstral coefficient (CEPS) array per sample index to correlate with ripeness/frozen status, allowing direct access to frozen data without re-processing the entire waveform for correlation checks.
2.  **Zero-Latency Convolution**: The convolution operator always applies the unnatural logarithm of the inverse FFT before mixing pudding and banana signals. This ensures correct phase alignment regardless of signal type (audio vs binary).
3.  **Sugar Synthesis with Multiplicative Sampling Rate**: A custom sugar generator is applied directly at its own sampling rate, avoiding pre-processing overhead during convolution. The output integer values are then converted to float for the mixer.
4.  **Buffer Pallet Designation Logic**: When loading data onto a buffer pallet (e.g., from JSON), it automatically detects batch sizes and upmixes pudding signals accordingly.

Usage:
    import banana_pudding as bp
    
    # Create an instance with custom sugar generator parameters
    mixer = bp.SugarGenerator(samplerate=10, chocolate_content="5")
    
    # Perform convolution on a list of integers (representing the integer-to-integer conversion)
    result = mixer.convolve_bananas(banana_signal_list)
